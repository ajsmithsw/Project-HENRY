# Project H.E.N.R.Y

Check out the series at [https://mycoding.blog](https://mycoding.blog/2017/06/14/filenew-personal-ai-assistant/).


## Brief

A voice-activated AI assistant, with a real-time animated avatar, built using .NET and running with the mono runtime on a Raspberry Pi.

## Progress

###### Week 1: 

Build a simple console-based chat bot, powered by a mildly-trained AI engine.

###### Week 2:

Train the engine to understand commands that I want my assistant to act upon.

###### Week 3:

Implement always-on speech recognition, to activate the chat features when a certain phrase is detected (think “Hey, Siri”).

###### Week 4:

Achieve a complete audio ‘conversation’ with my AI

###### Week 5:

Implement a simple graphical avatar (the ‘face’ of my AI) which reacts to commands with facial expressions

###### Week 6:

Deploy the project to a Raspberry Pi, and enjoy!
